## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- XAMPP/WAMP/LAMP stack
- PHP 7.4+
- MySQL 5.7+
- Python 3.13+ (for facial recognition)
- Face recognition libraries

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or extract the project files** to your web server directory
   ```
   c:/xampp/htdocs/Student-Attendance-Management-System-main/
   ```

2. **Create the database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE tbl;
   ```

3. **Import the database schema**
   ```sql
   USE tbl;
   SOURCE DATABASE FILE/attendancesystem.sql;
   ```

4. **Configure database connection**
   Edit `Includes/dbcon.php` with your database credentials:
   ```php
   $host = "localhost";
   $user = "root";
   $pass = "root"; // Change to your MySQL password
   $db = "tbl";
   ```

5. **Set up Python environment for facial recognition**
   ```bash
   pip install face-recognition
   pip install numpy
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

6. **Configure Python path**
   Update the Python path in recognition files to match your installation:
   ```php
   $python = escapeshellarg("C:\\Python313\\python.exe");
   ```

7. **Set file permissions**
   Ensure uploads directory has write permissions:
   ```
   chmod 755 recognition/uploads/
   ```

8. **Start the web server**
   ```
   Start Apache and MySQL services
   ```
